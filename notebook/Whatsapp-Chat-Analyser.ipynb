Can someone be tracked in Google Meet?\\nAns: - Attendance tracking is retained in Meet for a short time. Report any tracking issues as soon as possible. Attendance tracking and live stream reports will be enabled by default for your organization and can be turned on or off by Administrators.\\n2. Can Google Meet track your IP address?\\nAns: - Joining a google meet causes your browser to talk with STUN servers to see their IP and those are sent to the Google Meet servers to be send to other participants. You receive the IPs of the others.\\n3. Can a random person track your IP address?\\nAns: - Yes, tracing your IP address is legal if it is not used for criminal activities. The websites you visit, apps you use, and even your ISP collect your IP address along with other personal information. However, individual users can also easily trace your IP address.\\n4. Can I be tracked if my location is off?\\nAns: - The answer is yes, it\\'s possible to track mobile phones even if location services are turned off. Turning off the location service on your phone can help conceal your location. This is important if you do not want third parties knowing where you are or being able to track your movement. Google Meet will automatically track your location based on Ip address.\\n5. Can police track someone by IP?\\nAns: - So, if you are wondering if the police can track your phone numbers and IP addresses, the answer is - yes, they can. While the police cannot search your phone without a warrant, they have a legal right to watch what you do in public, on social media, and in your home and business.\\n6. Which is more secure Google Meet or zoom?\\nAns: - Google Meet is more secure than zoom. It encrypts messages but does not use end-to-end encryption. Messages are encrypted “in transit”. This means that they are only encrypted between your device and Google\\'s servers.\\n\\nN.B.: - There are multiple issues. Do not force us to implement Cyber Bullying charges on you. If caught you will be suspended from the College and put to rigorous imprisonment. If you have shared the google meet link with your friends to do mischief law will take its own course.\\n22/04/2023, 12:20 - +91 98316 40627: <Media omitted>\\n22/04/2023, 12:50 - Your security code with ~\\u202fSubir Bhadra changed.

So all of you are advised not to consider the Teachers names any further and moreover though you will be able to see the correct teachers tagged names you are advised not to ask questions about the justification of your marks. You must believe in your faculties and no one out of grievance or partiality is giving bad or good marks.
