I am working on an ML model to predict expected CTC. *Problem*: Suppose I want to know if a certain categorical variable is relevant for predicting this variable, I am opting to assess the boxplot of this categorical feature for different levels. Is there a better way to assess this relationship? In simpler terms, I want to know if expected CTC changes when organization of the candidate is different.\n",

That's why I implied that it doesn't matter which organization is the candidate coming from, the expected CTC is kind of independent of this feature.\n",
